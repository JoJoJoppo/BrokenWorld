Lux_2.0

Lux 2.0 – for Unity 5
(last tested version: Unity 5.0.2)

Lux 2.0 is built around the new lighting features in Unity 5.0.
It uses the built in diffuse ambient spherical harmonics and specular ambient reflection probes as well as global illumination and physically based shading.
Lux shaders do not always use Unity’s standard BRDF but rely on it where ever it suits.
